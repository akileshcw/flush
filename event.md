Key Events and Corresponding Actions

In a microservices architecture, events represent significant state changes that trigger actions across various services (e.g., Patient Management, Appointment Scheduling, Notifications, etc.). These events are typically communicated via a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ). Below is a list of key events, their triggers, and the actions they initiate in relevant services.

1\. PatientCreated

Trigger: A new patient is registered in the system with details like name, email, phone number, date of birth, preconditions, etc., and a member ID is generated.

Actions:

Notification Service: Send a welcome message to the patient.

Business Analytics Service: Increment the count of new patients for reporting.

Logic: After saving the patient to the database, publish the event with the patient’s ID for other services to react.

2\. PatientUpdated

Trigger: An existing patient’s record (e.g., name, email, phone number) is modified.

Actions:

Patient Portal Service: Update cached patient data to reflect changes.

Audit Service (if applicable): Log the update for tracking purposes.

Logic: After updating the patient record, emit the event to ensure downstream services stay in sync.
